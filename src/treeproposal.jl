    TreeProposal(tree::RuleNode, movement::Symbol, p_mov::Float64, p_mov_inv::Float64)

A proposal generated in one MCMC iteration.

- `tree`: the new proposed tree.
- `movement`: a symbol indicating the movement that was performed.
- `p_mov`: the probability of jumping from the old tree to the proposal.
- `p_mov_inv`: the probability of jumping from the proposal to the old tree.
